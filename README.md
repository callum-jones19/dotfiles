# Dotfiles

## Summary

Just another ðŸŽ† dotfiles ðŸŽ† repository. Where possible, this set of dotfiles is
designed to be relatively understandable and flexible. If a program is not
installed, the dotfiles should still all load

## Currently configured

Dotfiles are currently being tracked for:

- Bash
- [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)
- [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)
- [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
